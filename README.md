# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to utilize HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript to create a Study guide using the skills I have learnt.
I built this project to create a good foundation of these 4 areas which I believe will help me going forward in my learning of these topics.
This solves a problem of having an area to practice these skills on and also have a tidy place to keep notes on what I have learnt.
While going through this project I have learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I have learnt how to create a webpage and also how to use Git and repos to keep it on the web.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a place to keep notes about certain topics such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. The notes can be added to in the HTML section and can be kept up-to-date. 
If the DevTools console is opened on this webpage we can see the JavaScript running. This will list the topics that we have learnt so far from the prework and it will also randomly choose a topic for us to study first.
